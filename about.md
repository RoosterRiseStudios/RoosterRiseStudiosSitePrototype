**Love is just a four letter word.** No doubt about it.
At least in the  English language this is perfectly true, which is easy to (jokingly) prove in a short Haskell REPL session:

```haskell
λ> length "love" == 4
True
```

On the other hand, it feels totally wrong. Bob Dylan's song is a good example:
The Lady uttering this phrase seems using it as a kind of magic spell trying to avoid getting hurt by deeper emotions.
But in doing so, she in turn hurts the people who are in love with her.

So stating "love is a four letter word" is true, but reduces the actual phenomenon to a meaningless sequence of characters 
and does not help to explain anything. (This may also be the reason why there are so many songs proclaiming "love is *not* a four letter word".)

**Lambda is not a four letter word** is true in the same sense:

```haskell
λ> length "lambda" /= 4
True
```

And in quite the same way as the sentence on love it does not help.
It's not wrong in the orthographical sense, but it does not help to get any deeper insights into λ-calculus or functional programming.

Since it is apparently impossible to say anything meaningful about λ in such short statements, there is probably no way around approaching this phenomenon in somewhat longer texts. Hence this Blog!
