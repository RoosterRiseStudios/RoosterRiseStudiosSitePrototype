Some weeks ago I gave an introductory talk on functional programming at an in-house mini-conference where I tried to explain basic concepts of functional programming to a crowd of developers with their backgrounds mostly in imperative and OO languages.

Initially I had planned to present the contents of my [Why Haskell Matters article](https://thma.github.io/posts/2020-04-01-why-haskell-matters.html) but that turned out impractical because of the time constraints of my talk.

So I prepared a condensed slide deck focussing on the more elementary sections, which worked quite well.

Recently I stumbled across [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell), a Haskell kernel for the Jupyter Notebook platform. As I like the interactive approach of Jupyter notebooks I transferred my presentation into the Jupyter notebook format.

As I'm quite happy with the result I'd like to make it available to a wider audience. I have prepared three different versions:

1. [The raw notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thma/IHaskellExperiments/main/WhatsAwesomeAboutFunctionalProgramming.ipynb). You can open it in your local Jupyter + IHaskell setup [(Please follow this installation guide)](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell#installation) to enjoy the full interactivity that Jupyter notebooks provide.

2. The notebook as rendered by 
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thma/IHaskellExperiments/blob/main/WhatsAwesomeAboutFunctionalProgramming.ipynb).
Unfortunately it's not interactive. But you won't need a local Jupyter installation.

3. A [reveal.js presentation](/static/WhatsAwesomeAboutFunctionalProgramming.slides.html) which I generated from the notebook. This version just needs a web-browser.
