Some weeks ago I gave an introductory talk on functional programming at a developer mini-conference where I tried to explain the basics of functional programming to a crowd of developers with their backgrounds mostly in imperative and OO languages.

Initially I had planned to present the contents of my [Why Haskell Matters article](https://thma.github.io/posts/2020-04-01-why-haskell-matters.html) but that turned out impractical because of the time constraints of my session.

So I prepared a condensed slide deck focussing on the more elementary sections, which worked quite well.

Recently I stumbled across [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell), a Haskell kernel for the Jupyter Notebook platform. As I like the interactive approach of Jupyter notebooks I transferred my presentation into the Jupyter notebook format.

[You can open this notebook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thma/IHaskellExperiments/main/WhatsAwesomeAboutFunctionalProgramming.ipynb) in your local Jupyter + IHaskell installation to enjoy the full interactivity that Jupyter notebooks provide.

[You can see it in a notebook viewer here.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/thma/IHaskellExperiments/blob/main/WhatsAwesomeAboutFunctionalProgramming.ipynb)

I also used Jupyter to generate a [reveal.js presentation](/static/WhatsAwesomeAboutFunctionalProgramming.slides.html) from the notebook.

Enjoy !
